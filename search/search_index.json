Although journeyman provdes some similar features, it doesn't primarily serve to bootstrap the development pipeline but rather to aid a developer during development work. It doesn't care at all what module bundler or linter you use.\n\n\n\n\nActive development:\n Journeyman is being developed currently.

Using the \nlist\n command, you can view a list of all available sub-commands that will be detailed in the following sections:\n\n\njourn list\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected filesystem structure\n\n\nJourneyman assumes your project is set up a certain way by default. This is important because any generated code must be placed in the appropriate directories. While you can configure each path (see the \nconfiguration section\n), the default structure is the best practice all \nvue-cli\n templates follow, for example.\n\nThe below filesystem tree is the structure journeyman expects:\n\n\n\n.                    \n<\n--- Working directory journ is executed in\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 build/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 config/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 public/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 components/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 mixins/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 modules/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 router/\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 styles/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 static/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 test/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 package.json\n\n\n\n\njourn make\n\n\nThe \nmake\n command creates new files on the file system. It allows to bootstrap components, mixins and modules, for example. Use \njourn list make\n to view a list of available boots to strap (heh).\n\n\njourn make component\n\n\nAllows to bootstrap components. The component name passed as the third parameter can be either a filesystem path (\n/foo/bar/MyNewComponent.vue\n), a kebab-case (\nmy-new-component\n) or a CamelCase (\nMyNewComponent\n) name. In each case, the name will be parsed and the file will be generated with the correct format (\nConfig: \npreferred_spelling\n) at the right location (\nConfig: \npaths.components\n)\nGenerated components are described in detail later on.  \n\n\n# Bootstrap a new, empty component\n\njourn make component MyNewComponent\n\n\n# You can use shorthands, too\n\njourn m c MyNewComponent\n\n\n\n\n\nJourneyman also supports extends and mixins as well as cloning:\n\n\n# New component extending another\n\njourn make component MyOtherComponent --extends MyNewComponent\n\n\n# New component using one or more mixins\n\njourn make component MyOtherComponent --with oneMixin --with anotherMixin\n\n\n# New component based on another\n\njourn make component MyOtherComponent --from MyNewComponent\n\n\n\n\n\nCloned components will have all properties from the source component but with a new name.\n\n\njourn make mixin\n\n\nAllows to bootstrap mixins.  \n\n\n\n\nTODO HERE\n\n\n\n\njourn make route\n\n\n\n\nTODO HERE\n\n\n\n\njourn make module\n\n\n\n\nTODO HERE\n\n\n\n\njourn make style\n\n\n\n\nTODO HERE\n\n\n\n\njourn extract\n\n\nThe \nextract\n command allows extraction of code into mixins, styles into stylesheets and large templates into individual components.\n\n\n\n\nTODO HERE\n\n\n\n\njourn inline\n\n\nThe exact opposite of the \nextract\n command, \ninline\n allows to inline external code into your components.\n\n\n\n\nTODO HERE\n\n\n\n\njourn lint\n\n\nThe \nlint\n command performs a Vue.js coding style check on your code-base. This allows you to verify all your components adhere to the same style rules. In contrary to \neslint\n for example, This will not check your JS code (there are a lot of perfectly fine tools for this job), but rather verify all your code is streamlined and follows best practices.\n\nThere are a bunch of linting rules available in \nthe configuration\n.\n\n\nAdditionally, if configured so, \nlint\n will check your JSDoc comments to make sure they a) exist, b) are complete and c) are correct. It will also look for repetitions throughout your components which are probably opportunities for mixins.\n\n\njourn config\n\n\nThe \nconfig\n command allows to read and write configuration values.\n\n\njourn config get\n\n\nUse the following command to read the configuration:\n\n\njourn config get \n[\nvalue\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\njourn config set\n\n\nUse the following command to set a configuration value:\n\n\njourn config \nset\n \nkey\n \nvalue\n\n\n\n\n\n\njourn config init\n\n\nUse the following command to write the default configuration values to your \npackage.json\n or \n.journeyman\n file. This way, you've got all available configuration values at hand to modify them to your liking:\n\n\njourn config init \n[\n--package,-p\n]\n \n[\n--dotfile,-d\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the \n--package\n or \n--dotfile\n parameter, you can optionally specify the target: \npackage.json\n or \n.journeyman\n.\n\nThe default is \n--package\n.\n\n\n\n\nTODO HERE",

I can't stand packages like \nbody-parser\n that are secretly \nexpress.js\n plugins.\n\n\nTheir \npackage.json\n file includes a \njourneyman-plugin\n key:\n\n   This key provides plugin metadata. The available fields are outlined in \nPlugin metadata fields\n\n\nThey export a class (\nnot an instance!\n) from their main module that extends the base plugin:\n\n   Journeyman provides a base class at \nlib/plugins/Plugin\n that all plugins need to inherit from. It provides several methods Journeyman uses to initialize the plugin and work with it's input and output. This frees implementations from caring about API compatibility and implementation details.\n\n\n\n\nBasically, a plugin provides a new subcommand to journeyman that all its methods are grouped below. A simple plugin might look like this:\n\n\nconst\n \n{\n \nPlugin\n \n}\n \n=\n \nrequire\n(\njourneyman\n);\n\n\n\nclass\n \nEchoPlugin\n \nextends\n \nPlugin\n \n{\n\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * The static property \nname\n is used as the subcommand namespace for your plugin\n\n\n   */\n\n  \nstatic\n \nget\n \nname\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \necho\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * This is a private method (as far as JS supports it, at least...).

If journeyman finds the __invoke method  inside your plugin, it will disregard any other public methods.

In fact,  all  integrated commands are actually plugins. \nPlugins are special npm packages that must fulfill a few requirements:   Their package name starts with  journeyman-plugin- : \n   This serves to keep the npm namespace clean and make plugins more obvious. I can't stand packages like  body-parser  that are secretly  express.js  plugins.  Their  package.json  file includes a  journeyman-plugin  key: \n   This key provides plugin metadata. The available fields are outlined in  Plugin metadata fields  They export a class ( not an instance! ) from their main module that extends the base plugin: \n   Journeyman provides a base class at  lib/plugins/Plugin  that all plugins need to inherit from. It provides several methods Journeyman uses to initialize the plugin and work with it's input and output. This frees implementations from caring about API compatibility and implementation details.   Basically, a plugin provides a new subcommand to journeyman that all its methods are grouped below. A simple plugin might look like this:  const   {   Plugin   }   =   require ( journeyman );  class   EchoPlugin   extends   Plugin   { \n\n   /**     * The static property  name  is used as the subcommand namespace for your plugin     */ \n   static   get   name ()   { \n     return   echo ; \n   } \n\n   /**     * This is a private method (as far as JS supports it, at least...).
